A 2D gravitational simulator made with [Löve]. Read my [blog post](https://yunru.se/blog/how-not-to-do-gravity) about it for more info.

As the simulation speeds up it becomes less accurate.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dbf4ceb23861854274c5a15/1572846759769-VSOGURMFWC71X8Y91BND/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHTltL2lmdnsJxFL_LED5_FZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVGsg7I3aR9l36tvEixSmJtkpbMOeVpyzg_lzaMSRJTOf1tO8nJtk629tZGIWiyY3XQ/yizzy-orbit-perspectives.gif?format=1000w)

## Instructions

Download [Löve], extract this to a folder of your choice, edit `yizzy.bat` to your install path, and play away.

In addition to the tools available on 1, 2, 3 and 6, the following controls exist:

* Space: pause and play simulation
* Scrollwheel: zoom in and out
* Shift-scrollwheel: Make time run faster or slower
* F5: Restart
* F11: Fullscreen
* 9: Go into grid move
* 8: Show gravitational field strength (press F2 to render - it's slow!)
* D: Toggle debug display
* T: Toggle body titles
* P: Toggle paths
* C: Toggle connections between bodies
* V: Toggle velocity vector
* B: Toggle body
